Healthcare access should not be limited by language barriers. 

Thatâ€™s why my team and I developed MedLink, a platform designed to connect individuals with healthcare professionals regardless of their native language by offering real-time translation for users to navigate healthcare resources.

As part of the development team, I played a key role in designing and developing the MedLink software to ensure an intuitive and accessible user experience.

This project has been an incredible opportunity to combine tech and healthcare to make a real impact.
